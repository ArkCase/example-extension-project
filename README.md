# Extension Project for ArkCase

This project houses the overall base structure to construct an extension for [ArkCase](https://www.arkcase.com/).  It's divided into three subprojects, each with a different responsibility:

* [***config***](config) houses the configuration customizations applicable for the extension
* [***extension***](extension) houses the extension's code itself
* [***bundle***](bundle) houses the assembly descriptor to construct the final deployable artifact.
